# Sample_Basketball_Data_Dashboard

This data dashboard is a sample of a product that I built and maintain for a Division I college basketball team via R Shiny. 
The purpose of the dashboard is to assist the coaching staff by providing insights on player fatigue, injury prevention and in-game performance.
The dashboard contains a variety of data visualization tools such as raincloud plots and radar charts via the ggplot and fmsb packages in R.
The dashboard has helped the team better manage player fatigue, improve player preparedness for games, and minimize the potential for injuries.
